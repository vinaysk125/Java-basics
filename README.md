Day 2: Loops & Arrays in Java
Day 2: Loops & Arrays
Loops

for loop → runs when number of iterations is known

while loop → runs until a condition becomes false

do-while loop → runs at least once before checking condition

break → exit loop early

continue → skip current iteration

Nested loops → loop inside another loop (used in patterns, tables)

Examples practiced:

Counting 1 to 10

Even numbers between 1–20

Multiplication table (user input)

Simple patterns with *

Arrays

Definition: Collection of elements of the same type stored in contiguous memory

Declaring: int[] arr = new int[5];

Initializing: int[] arr = {1, 2, 3};

Access via index: arr[0]

Enhanced for loop → for(int num : arr) (reads each element directly)

Examples practiced:

Take 5 integers from user → print sum & average

Find largest and smallest element from array
